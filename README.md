# Pick-and-Deliver-Objects-to-the-Professor
## Project Introduction

TIAGo is a service robot designed to work in indoor environments.  

In this project, we work with TIAGo for a complete service task: when people is offering TIAGo a cup, he is able to react to it and take over the cup, then look around searching for Professor and deliver the cup.

## Perception Part 

### 1. Gesture Detection based on OpenPose

[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) is the state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, which enables a real-time multi-person key-point detection for body, face, and hands estimation.

### 2. Face Detection based on Python Library Face Recognition 

Face Detection is a Python Library which is built using [dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark.

### 3. Object Detection based on YOLO

[You only look once (YOLO)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)  is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPS and has a mAP of 57.9% on COCO test-dev.
